Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Project

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. With financial security being a top priority for both customers and credit card companies, identifying potential fraud early can prevent unauthorized charges and mitigate risks.

Project Overview

The dataset used includes credit card transactions from European cardholders over two days in September 2013. Out of 284,807 transactions, only 492 are classified as fraud, making this a highly imbalanced dataset (fraud cases account for only 0.172%). To protect user privacy, all features have been anonymized through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), except for Time (elapsed time since the first transaction) and Amount (transaction value).

Key Highlights

Data Preprocessing: Addressing class imbalance and scaling features appropriately.
Modeling Techniques: Using various algorithms optimized for detecting the minority class.
Evaluation Metrics: Focusing on metrics like Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), Precision, Recall, and F1-score to accurately assess fraud detection performance.
